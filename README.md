# Comp-Sci-Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jacob, a recent graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about leveraging technology to create innovative solutions that meet user needs, and I thrive in collaborative team environments where ideas come to life.

During my studies, I specialized in database architecture, software development, and integrating AI algorithms into practical applications. I also took on leadership roles, coordinating team schedules, delegating tasks, and ensuring consistent progress through effective follow-ups. These experiences have honed both my technical expertise and my ability to guide teams toward achieving their goals.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Software Development and Database topics.

## Portfolio Projects

### Dashboard Improvement
**Goal:** To develop and update four dashboards/graphs for Turlock Irrigation District (TID). Also needed to be developed in specific packages and languages approved by TID.

**Description:** The project focused on reading from TID's database, pulling the data to a REST API, then finally porting the data over to a visualization package, Grafana.

**Skills:** Data analysis, data visualization, REST API

**Technology:** C#, Python, MS SQL Server

**Results:** Successfully developed and deployed the dashboards into production environment.

### L Game
**Code:** Here is the [source code](https://github.com/jacobmyung/L-game/blob/main/L-game.py) in its repository.

**Goal:** Implement a playable human VS AI mode of the [L game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_game). The AI would have to use AI game search algorithms and respond with an appropraite move.

**Description:** The project focused on implementing efficient calls to search many gamestates using evaluation functions and pruning algorithms.

**Skills:** Hashmaps, greedy search

**Technology:** Python

**Results:** Successfully developed and implemented greedy search by creating a evaluation function of each gamestate. Further work for implementing other algorithms such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

### Warehouse Inventory Database
**Code:** Here is the [source code](https://github.com/jacobmyung/CSE-111-Databases-Project/blob/main/project.py) in its repository.

**Goal:** Create a inventory and ordering UI for both warehouse workers and customers, respectively.

**Description:** This project created a database where users would either log in as either a worker or a customer. Customers would be able to create orders and purchase items from the catalogue, and these orders would then decrement the inventory for those products. Workers were able to mark orders as completed or canceled, increase the inventory count of items, and see a map of where a specific item is located in the warehouse.

**Skills:** database creation, query management, updates, many-to-many relationships

**Technology:** SQLite, Python

**Results:** Successfully created a database with working inventory tracking. 9 different use cases for four different users were implemented.
