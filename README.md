# Comp-Sci-Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Jacob. I am a recent college Graduate with a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. I also have strong foundations in the natural sciences as a former Chemical Engineering student. I am excited to work in team environments to develop solutions towards user needs.

During my studies, I focused on database architecture and management, as well as integrating and developing AI programs. Additionally, I would take the lead role of organizing team members schedules, distrubiting workloads, and following up on each members progress week by week.

My CV in [pdf]().

This is a repository to showcase my skills, share projects, and track my progress in Software Development and Database topics.
